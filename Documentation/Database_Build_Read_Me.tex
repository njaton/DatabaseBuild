\section{Goal}
	The goal of this project was to get familiar with connecting to databases using Java and MySQL. 

\section{Project Overview} 
	This project contains four different classes used to create and alter the database. The main class is rather self explanatory and is just used to call the methods to get the program running."build1" holds the methods that are used to connect to the database and create the template of the "SnakeSpecies" table. "DataFill" is used to fill in the database either by text file or user input based off of the users choice. This class also has a method built in to delete the current data residing in the table. The user is able to access these options due to the "UserInt" class which works as a menu system for the application. 

\section{Additional Notes} 
	In order to use this table building application you will have to attach it to your personal schema. This is very easy to do using MySQL. In fact, the stock username / password was used in the code so they should not need to be changed.
